# Principles

Cloud Native infrastructure encompasses many, many things these days. We do not expect anyone to be an expert in everything--that is impossible! Rather, we look for key traits:

**GRIT** - We are a scale-up. It's fun, challenging, and demanding. GRIT is the number one trait we look for when finding someone who we believe will be successful, contributing to a world class organization. Learn more about GRIT: https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/

**Creativity** - Successful individuals are those that think outside the box. They are willing to question the norms and speak up about their thoughts and ideas in an effort to make everyone better.

**Coachable** - We want people who want to be better, learn from their peers, and educate them selves. This space evolves fast, we must evolve with it.

**Mentors** - In order to be successful we have to mentor each other. Again, this space is vast, no one person can know it all. We expect everyone to contribute their knowledge back to their peers. Some people will be more knowledgeable in some areas, that's not only great, it's expected. You need to be willing to coach your peers to raise everybody up.

**Cultural Contribution** - We have a lot of fun, everyone supports each other and lifts each other up, and we work hard to help everyone be as successful as they can be. Many of us come from different backgrounds and we're stronger for that. We don't tolerate negative behaviour and we encourage collaboration and team ethic. This isn't just about technical knowledge, but also professional experiences.
